    summary:
      "Genesis is the first book in the Old Testamentâ€Š section of the Bible. The Book of Genesis explains that God created a beautiful world (Genesis 1). But the first people did not obey God (Genesis 3). Everyone suffers because of this. Genesis is a history book. It tells the life stories of many important people. For example, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Ishmael, Jacob, and Joseph and his brothers. Jesus was born 1600 years after the events at the end of Genesis. But even in the book of Genesis, God promised that Jesus would come. See Genesis 3:15, Galatians 3:6-20, Hebrews 7 and Hebrews 11:1-22.",

    book: "Exodus",
    summary:
      "Exodus is a history book in the Bible's Old Testament. And Exodus is also a law book. The people called Hebrews were slaves in Egypt. God sent Moses to free them (Exodus 3). The people in Egypt did not want to free these slaves. But God caused many terrible troubles in Egypt. These troubles forced the people in Egypt to free their Hebrew slaves. So, the Hebrew people left Egypt. God promised the land called Israel to the Hebrew people. But the journey to Israel was through a desert. God did many wonderful things to help the people through the desert. God provided water (Exodus 17) and food (Exodus 16). Moses met God at a mountain called Sinai (Exodus 19). There, God gave the law to Moses (Exodus chapters 20-30). Moses made a special tent where the priests would serve God (Exodus chapters 35-40).",

    book: "Leviticus",
    summary:
      "The Book of Leviticus is about the law of God. The law teaches us that God is holy. The Book of Leviticus contains many rules for the Hebrew people. But we do not obey all the rules in Leviticus today, because we trust Jesus (see Galatians 3:23-25). The Book of Leviticus also describes the duties of priests during the time of the Old Testament. And, in Leviticus 23, there is a list of special holidays, when the Hebrew people praised God together. God also told the people that they must kill animals. And, they gave these animals to God. The people did this so that God would forgive their evil deeds (Leviticus chapters 1-7). This teaches us why Jesus had to die. Jesus died so that today, God forgives our evil deeds. We must confess our evil deeds to God. And we must invite God into our lives. The Book of Leviticus is in the Old Testament part of the Bible.",

Moses counted the people in Numbers 1 and Numbers 26. The people did not always obey God. They complained about the food in the desert (Numbers 11 and Numbers 21). They refused to enter the land that God had promised to them (Numbers 13). They even wanted to return to Egypt (Numbers 14). This is why they were in the desert for 40 years. The Book of Numbers also tells the story of Balaam. Balaam was a foreign prophet (holy man). Balaam intended to announce an evil fate for the people. But instead, Balaam saw that God was with them. Balaam spoke only the words that God wanted him to say. So, Balaam blessed the people (Numbers chapters 22-24).",

These 'judges' were not like judges today. They were holy men (and one woman), whom God called. They led the people in battles. And they helped the people to serve God. When there was a judge, the people obeyed God. And God helped the people in their battles against their enemies. But, when there was no judge, the people forgot God. And God allowed their enemies to be strong. So, the people asked God to help. And then, God appointed another judge. (Judges 2:16-19).

This was God's law. And one man who respected this law was called Boaz. So, Ruth came to Boaz's field to collect grain. Boaz saw Ruth and he loved her.

For many centuries, Israel had no kings. The people did whatever they wanted to do. But God appointed special judges to lead the people. The last of these special judges was Samuel (1 Samuel 7:15). Samuel was a very holy man. When Samuel was old, the people asked Samuel to appoint a king (1 Samuel 8). God told Samuel to appoint Saul. Saul sometimes obeyed God. But sometimes, Saul was evil. So, God chose David to be king instead of Saul (1 Samuel 16). David trusted God. We see this when David fought Goliath (1 Samuel 17). And David loved God. But David did not become king immediately. Saul was still the king. David respected Saul. David even refused to attack Saul. The book of 1 Samuel ends with the story of Saul's death.",

In these history books, the Bible contains many examples which teach how we should live (2 Timothy 3:16). 1 Kings begins with the story of Solomon. Solomon was a wise king at first (1 Kings 3). Then he became rich (1 Kings 10:14-29). He built a temple (house of God) in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6). But then Solomon took many wives. When he was old, they encouraged him to serve evil gods (1 Kings 11). After Solomon died, there was a revolution. The country called Israel became two countries. The south was called Judah. Rehoboam was the first king of Judah. The north was still called Israel. Here Jeroboam became king (1 Kings 12). The writer wants to teach a lesson. When the kings obeyed God, the people were at peace. When the kings did not obey God, but served other gods, bad things happened. When the people of Israel stopped serving God, he sent a prophet (a holy man). He was Elijah. He did wonderful things. He told the people to serve God again.",

    book: "2 Kings",
    summary:
      "2 Kings continues the story of the nations of Israel and Judah. It is a history book, from the Old Testament of the Bible. In these history books, the Bible contains many important lessons for us today (2 Timothy 3:16). 2 Kings describes how the kings of these nations refused to obey God's law. The kings and their people did not respect God. Instead, they served evil gods. And the behaviour of the people was very wicked. However, there were a few people who truly served God. And God sent his servants to warn the evil people. But the nations of Israel and Judah would not obey the words of the prophets. God allowed enemy nations to attack. These nations destroyed Israel and (later) Judah. And the soldiers took the inhabitants of Israel and Judah to distant countries. But God still cared about the people from Israel and Judah. God promised that, in the future, these people (or their children or grandchildren) would return home. 2 Kings begins with the end of the story of Elijah. Elijah was a great prophet of God. And God did not allow Elijah to die. Instead, Elijah went up to heaven. Elijah's companion was a man named Elisha. Elisha saw Elijah rise to heaven, in a vehicle of fire (2 Kings 2). Elisha himself became a great prophet. Indeed, Elisha's work was even greater than Elijah's work. God gave Elisha power to do many wonderful things, for example: Elisha caused a dead child to live (2 Kings 4:8-37). Elisha made poisonous food safe (2 Kings 4:38-41). By God's power, Elisha cured Naaman. Naaman was the captain of a foreign army (2 Kings 5). Israel even won battles without a fight, because of Elisha (2 Kings 6:8-23). The king of Israel, Joram, saw these wonderful things. But he was still an evil king. He still served false gods. And his wicked mother, Queen Jezebel, was still alive. Then, God sent Elisha to a man named Jehu. Elisha appointed Jehu king of Israel. Jehu killed both Joram and Jezebel. God had promised that these evil rulers would die a terrible death. Jehu also killed many other evil people. Jehu even killed the priests of the false god named Baal. But Jehu still served other false gods. So, even Jehu did not truly serve the real God (2 Kings 9-10). There were also terrible troubles in the nation of Judah. Queen Athaliah tried to kill the whole royal family. But a little boy named Joash survived. A priest named Jehoida helped Joash. Joash was 7 years old when the army captains killed Queen Athaliah. Then, Joash became king (2 Kings 11). And for many years, Joash was a good king. He repaired the temple (house of God) in Jerusalem. But after Jehoida died, Joash did some evil things. He took some holy objects from the temple. And then, he killed Jehoida's son, who was a prophet (holy man) (2 Chronicles 24:22). Soon afterwards, Joash's officials killed Joash (2 Kings 12). After this, there were many evil kings. There were wars. There was even a war between Israel and Judah. And there were also some prophets (holy men). The prophet Jonah lived at this time. The last king of Israel was called Hoshea. The king of the nation of Assyria attacked Israel. And he destroyed Israel (2 Kings 17). The king of Assyria gave the land to people from other countries. These people served God, but they also served false gods. God does not like this. We must serve the real God only. The nation of Judah still existed. Its next king was a good king named Hezekiah. Hezekiah trusted God, but he made some important mistakes. When Hezekiah was in trouble, he prayed to God. So God sent the prophet Isaiah to Hezekiah. And God helped Hezekiah (2 Kings chapters 18-20). Hezekiah's son, Manasseh, was very evil. Manasseh served terrible gods. He was a cruel man, who killed innocent people. God was angry when he saw these evil actions. So, God decided to destroy the nation of Judah, too (2 Kings 21:1-18). But then, Josiah became king. Josiah was Manasseh's grandson. He was just a boy when he became king. Josiah was a good king. In fact, he was Judah's greatest ever king (2 Kings chapters 22-23). Josiah served God. Josiah loved God's law. Josiah encouraged the people to trust God. And Josiah repaired God's temple (the house of God). So, God was kind to the nation of Judah. And God did not punish Judah during Josiah's life. But, after Josiah's death, all the kings of Judah were evil. God allowed Nebuchadnezzar (king of Babylon) to attack Jerusalem. Jerusalem was the capital city of Judah. And Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem. He destroyed the whole country called Judah. This was very sad. Jeremiah (who was another prophet) wrote about this event in the Book of Lamentations. When the kings served God, God helped them. But when the kings did evil things, God opposed them. God sent his servants, the prophets, to warn the kings. But when the kings refused to obey the prophets, God punished their nations. We should learn from the book of 2 Kings. We must serve God only. We must not serve false gods. And, we must listen to God's words. If we do evil deeds, God might send someone to warn us. So, we must listen to other people's advice.",

The Jews started to build a temple (house of God) in Jerusalem. But the people who lived near them did not want the Jews back in the land. They opposed the Jews so that the Jews did not continue to build the temple. Many years later, God helped the Jews and they finished the building. Many years after that, Ezra led another group of Jews who returned to Judah. Ezra was a teacher who taught the people from God's word.

Babylon was a long way from their country, called Judah. Many years later, the army from Persia defeated the army from Babylon. The king of Persia allowed the Jews to return to their own land. Only some of the Jews returned to Judah. Many years later a man called Hanani left Judah to visited his brother, Nehemiah. Nehemiah was an important servant of the king of Persia. Nehemiah asked Hanani for news about Jerusalem, which was the chief city in Judah. Hanani told Nehemiah that the walls of Jerusalem were only heaps of stones. Fire had burned the gates of the city. This news made Nehemiah very sad. So Nehemiah asked the king to send him to Jerusalem to build the walls of the city again. The book of Nehemiah in the Bible tells the story of how Nehemiah and the people built the walls of Jerusalem again. The people who lived near Jerusalem did not want the Jews to build the city again. They opposed the Jews and tried to stop the work. But God helped them and they finished the work in 52 days. God wanted the Jews to become his special people again. So Nehemiah, with the help of Ezra, helped the people to obey God. But often the people did not obey God's word. They had forgotten that God had punished the people many years earlier. He did that because they did not obey him. God had allowed a foreign king to defeat the Jews. That was why the city of Jerusalem needed these repairs.",

The king of Persia was angry with the queen and he sent her away. Then he searched for another wife who would be the new queen. He chose Esther. One of the king's chief officials, called Haman, hated the Jews and he plotted to destroy them. But Esther's uncle Mordecai asked Esther to speak to the king to save the Jews. Although Esther was the queen, Mordecai was asking her to do a dangerous thing. People could not go to see the king if he had not invited them. But Esther did what Mordecai asked. The king was pleased with her and listened to her. The king gave to the evil Haman the punishment that Haman had wanted to give to the Jews. The book of Esther does not mention the name of God. This is strange for a book that is in the Bible. Sometimes God seems to be silent. We might even think that he does not care about us. The writer of the book of Esther probably wanted his readers to realise that God is always in control. Although we cannot see God, he is always doing things in the world. Nobody can stop his plans. The events in the book of Esther show us that God is in control.",

So, they told the people about Jesus. The Christians explained that the people must confess their evil deeds to God. Then, they must invite God into their lives. The first Christians did wonderful things by God's power. Peter cured a man who could not walk by God's power (Acts 3:1-10). God even cured ill people when Peter's shadow went over them (Acts 5:15-16). Many people opposed the first Christians. A Christian called Stephen did many wonderful things (Acts 6:8). But the rulers opposed him. They did not want him to speak about Jesus. So, the rulers killed Stephen. But Stephen was not afraid. He knew that he was going to heaven. Like Jesus, Stephen prayed for the people who were killing him (Acts 7:60). But the number of Christians continued to increase. And new churches began in many areas, for example Samaria and Antioch. Soon, God taught Peter and the other Christians that God's good news is for everyone, from every nation (Acts 10). So, they began to speak to people who were not from Israel. Saul was a religious leader who opposed the first Christians. Saul even helped to kill Stephen (Acts 8:1). But God spoke to Saul on the road to Damascus. And Saul became a Christian (Acts 9). He travelled to many places, to tell everyone about Jesus (Acts chapters 13-28). Later, Saul changed his name to Paul. Paul wrote many books in the New Testament of the Bible.

The people in Greece were proud of their clever minds. But Paul explained that God considers human wisdom to be foolish. So, Christians must recognise that Jesus Christ is their Lord.

They will be loyal to their husbands or wives. They will not try to understand the Bible by their own clever ideas. Instead, they will be true servants of Christ (1 Corinthians chapters 5-6). Paul wanted to teach the Christians in Corinth how to praise God together. He taught them that they should share bread and wine to remember Jesus' death (1 Corinthians 11). God's Holy Spirit would help them to work together (1 Corinthians chapters 12 and 14). And God's greatest gift is love (1 Corinthians 13). Paul also taught about life after death.

In the Old Testament, priests killed animals so that God would forgive the people. But Jesus died himself, to suffer the punishment for our evil deeds. God accepted Jesus's blood (that is, his death - Hebrews 9). So, God will forgive us when we trust Jesus. In the Bible's Old Testament, many people trusted God (Hebrews 11). They believed that God would send Jesus. So, they were not afraid, although they had great troubles. So, we too should trust God when we have troubles (Hebrews 12:1-2).",

    book: "James",
    summary: "The book of James is a letter in the New Testament of the Bible. People think that the writer was James the brother of Jesus. He became a leader of the church in Jerusalem (Galatians 1:19). James tells his readers about different things: We may suffer because we follow Jesus. But we must be patient (James 5:7-11). This will make us better people (James 1:2-4) He speaks against rich people who do wrong things to poor people (James 2:1-4, James 5:1-7). God will say that they are wrong. If poor people trust God, this is better than wealth (James 2:5-7) God will give wisdom to those who ask for it (James 1:5). This is because true wisdom comes from God (James 1:16-18). God's wisdom teaches us the right behaviour (James 3:13-16). If we trust in God, we will show it in our actions (James 2:14-26). James warns us to be careful about our words (James 3:1-12). He tells us that we should pray sincerely (James 5:13-16). James is a favourite book for many people.",

    book: "1 Peter",
    summary: "1 Peter is a letter in the Bible's New Testament. The author of the letter is Peter. Peter was a disciple (student) of Jesus. And Peter became a leader in the first Christian church, in Jerusalem. Peter wrote his letter to Christians who were suffering great troubles. Peter wanted them to trust God more. Their troubles would test them. But they were joyful, even when they suffered. They were joyful, because they trusted God's promises. And they were joyful, because Jesus died for them. So, Peter encouraged them to be holy. Their troubles would last for a short time. But God's word lasts always. And they will always live with God in heaven. There, they will not suffer. God chose them to be his people (1 Peter 2:10). So, they were special people. They did not belong to this world (1 Peter 2:11). They belonged in heaven. Jesus suffered many terrible things, too. But he did not reply when people insulted him. He did not complain. He trusted God. And when Jesus died, he suffered the punishment for our evil deeds. This was how he made us into the people of God (1 Peter 2:21-25). We should copy Jesus, even when we suffer. We should respect our husbands and wives (1 Peter 3:1-7). We should respect our employers (1 Peter 2:18-21). And we should even respect rulers and governments (1 Peter 2:13-17). They might be evil. But we should still be good. We should tell them gently about Jesus (1 Peter 3:15). We might suffer because we are Christians. But even if this happens, we should be glad. And we should praise God that we are Christians (1 Peter 4:12-19). Peter advised these Christians to love each other (1 Peter 4:8). And, he had special advice for the church leaders (1 Peter 5:1-4).",

Then, we will enjoy the things that God promises: a new heaven, and a new earth.",
